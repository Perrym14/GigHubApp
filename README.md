# GigHubApp

## Descrption 
GigHub is a simple site that allows users to keep up to date with performing Artists. Users can track gigs they're attending or an artist they're following. An Artist can add a gig and specify what venue they're performing at, what date and time, and what genre of music it is. That artist can later edit or cancel a gig which then, would send notifications to users who are either attending that gig or following the artist. Users can also search for gigs that are performed by a specific artist, genre, or venue location.

**This app utilizes: ASP.NET MVC 5, Entity Framework 6, jQuery, Angular.JS, Visual Studio 2017, Moq, FluentAssertions, HTML5, CSS/LESS and NUnit.**
